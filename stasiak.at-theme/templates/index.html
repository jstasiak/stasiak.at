<h2>Programming projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I programmed the UI, minigame, environment interaction and sound system in Insomnia, a university first person perspective horror game project. I also wrote music for the game. The project participated in a faculty-wide competition and received a discintion for its atmosphere. See <a href="https://marcinpanasiuk.com/projects/insomnia/project.html">Marcin Panasiuk's writeup</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>
    I co-maintain some Open Source projects, of which the most notable are:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/injector">Injector - a Python dependency injection framework inspired by Guice</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf">python-zeroconf - a pure Python implementation of multicast DNS service discovery</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet">Eventlet - a concurrent networking library for Python</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/flask_injector">flask-injector - a Flask/Injector integration layer</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Other projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I wrote music for and produced a Polish language podcast Stacja Cisza (<a href="https://stacjacisza.pl">Stacja Cisza homepage</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaeogCEvPTWuw9BqiaMsl_A">Stacja Cisza on YouTube</a>). I primarily used Audacity for recording, processing and mixing the whole thing.</li>
  <li>I do some creative writing. One of my short stories was published in a <a href="http://iatelier.pl/nasze-projekty/okolo-fikcji/">Polish language creative writing workshop anthology Oko≈Ço Fikcji</a>. I also designed the anthology and prepared it for printing using <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> and a bunch of hacks.</li>
