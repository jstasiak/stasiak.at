Perfect is the friend of never

I read this article recently: `"VSCode's SSH Agent Is Bananas" by Thomas Ptacek
<https://fly.io/blog/vscode-ssh-wtf/>`_.

The author `says in a Hacker News comment <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979904>`_:

    I have been for like a month now noodling on a long-form post about a piece of software
    we've been noodling with for 3-4 years now. Kurt is freaking out, because we haven't
    written anything on the blog since, like August. Finally I'm like, look, I will write
    the simplest thing I can come up with. We'll do the opposite of what we've been doing.
    We'll do anti- effortposts. I bet I can do one in 30 minutes.

Then on the same day I read `Simon Willison's article titled "What to blog about"
<https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/>`_, most importantly this fragment:

    But what should you write about?

    It’s easy to get hung up on this. I’ve definitely felt the self-imposed pressure to only
    write something if it’s new, and unique, and feels like it’s never been said before.
    This is a mental trap that does nothing but hold you back.

Both of the quoted pieces of text triggered something in me.

It's a common situation I experience where I have an idea or a plan for a software project,
a hardware solution to a problem I have or a piece of writing I'd like to get out there.

The plans are grand, the thoughts go wild, the possibilities are limitless. Inevitably
and usually pretty quickly I start tackling all edge cases in my thoughts. I find – sometimes
even fix – problems with whatever it is that I plan. I consider the edge cases, I plan for
the future, I predict, I worry, I overengineer, on and on, again and again.

But you know the worst part of it? All this without writing a single line of code or a single
paragraph of an article.

This is part of why my last post here was written two and a half years ago.

It's not that I have nothing to say or to share. I have a home networking/VPN configuration
which improves on `my earlier VPN setup <{filename}a-semi-paranoid-multi-lan-wireguard-vpn.rst>`_.
I have a `Prehistorik 2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistorik_2>`_ reverse engineering
project that I don't even remember now when I started. I have some thoughts on software
development that I wanted to share for a long time now. There's more, all untackled.

Planning for perfection made me fail before I even started. The journey was finished before
walking out the door, without taking a single step. *A mental trap* indeed.

I want more of *let me write it down so I can share something interesting with people,
even if imperfect, I can iterate on it if needed*.

I want much less of *let me spend years trying to come up with the perfect thing and
never even start*.

Even with this article, knowing what I know and wanting to not get hung up on details,
it took me longer than I'd like to get it done – or even to write the first line. It's ok,
there's progress still. I need to internalize this – it doesn't have to be perfect and
that's fine.

They say *perfect is the enemy of good*. I'll say *perfect is the friend of never*.
