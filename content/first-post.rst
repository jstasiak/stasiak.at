Ok, this is meta. I'm using `Pelican <https://blog.getpelican.com>`_ for my site now and I want to publish
some posts/articles â€“ in order to do that I need a functioning article templates so that's what I'm
implementing right now (I could use an existing Pelican template but I fancy some tinkering and surely the
`NIH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here>`_ syndrom is at play here to some degree).
