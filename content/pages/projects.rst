Programming projects
====================

* I programmed the UI, minigame, environment interaction and sound system in Insomnia, a university
  first person perspective horror game project. I also wrote music for the game. The project
  participated in a faculty-wide competition and received a discintion for its atmosphere. See
  `Marcin Panasiuk's writeup <https://marcinpanasiuk.com/insomnia>`_ for more
  details.
* I co-maintain some Open Source projects, of which the most notable are:

  * `Injector - a Python dependency injection framework inspired by Guice
    <https://github.com/alecthomas/injector>`_
  * `python-zeroconf - a pure Python implementation of multicast DNS service discovery
    <https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf>`_
  * `Eventlet - a concurrent networking library for Python <https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet>`_
  * `flask-injector - a Flask/Injector integration layer <https://github.com/alecthomas/flask_injector>`_

  work.

Other projects
==============

* I wrote music for and produced a Polish language podcast Stacja Cisza (`Stacja Cisza homepage
  <https://stacjacisza.pl>`_, `Stacja Cisza on YouTube
  <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaeogCEvPTWuw9BqiaMsl_A>`_). I primarily used Audacity for recording,
  processing and mixing the whole thing.
* I do some creative writing. One of my short stories was published in a `Polish language creative
  writing workshop anthology Oko≈Ço Fikcji <http://iatelier.pl/nasze-projekty/okolo-fikcji/>`_. I also
  designed the anthology and prepared it for printing using `Asciidoctor <https://asciidoctor.org>`_ and
  a bunch of hacks.
